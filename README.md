## Note:
Before running the client, make sure to run the server first. This ensures that the server is up and running before the client tries to connect.

Additionally, it is important to check if the client is running on the same port locally as the server. This ensures that the client can establish a successful connection with the server.

To run the server and client:

1. Start the server by executing the appropriate command or running the server application.
2. Once the server is running, start the client by executing the appropriate command or running the client application.
3. Verify that the client is running on the same port as the server to establish a successful connection.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the server and client are properly configured and connected.
